# About this Fork

The purpose of this fork is to explore the possibility of integrating with Travis CI and other CI systems without granting them access to the account hosting the main repository.

# SiQAD

SiQAD (Silicon Quantum Atomic Designer) is a next-generation CAD tool that enables the design and simulation of silicon dangling bond (Si-DB) circuits through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) and a modular simulation back-end. The tool currently offers simulators that predict ground-state and dynamic electron configuration of given Si-DB configurations, and electrostatics simulation given electrode layouts. Please read the [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04916) for a detailed introduction to the tool and simulators, and visit the [Walus Lab website](https://waluslab.ece.ubc.ca/siqad/) for information about us and other projects that Walus Lab works on!


## Binary releases

Binary builds for Windows are available [here](https://github.com/retallickj/siqad/releases). [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=48145) is required to run the Hopping Dynamics simulator on Windows. Note that one of the first-party simulators, PoisSolver, is not available on Windows builds due to the lack Windows support of a dependent module, FEniCS. Future support for the Docker or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) versions of FEniCS [has been planned](https://github.com/retallickj/siqad/issues/33).

For now, Linux and macOS binaries are not distributed and requires the user to build from source.

## Building from source on Linux

### Prerequisites

This tutorial is based on Ubuntu 17.10, and should also work on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. Install all dependencies on Ubuntu systems:
```
# gui, simanneal and hoppingdynamics dependencies
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-tk make gcc g++ qtchooser qt5-default libqt5svg5-dev qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libqt5charts5 libqt5charts5-dev libboost-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-thread-dev pkg-config
# poissolver dependencies
sudo apt install python3-dolfin gmsh swig
pip3 install --user pillow networkx matplotlib numpy shapely
# hoppingdynamics python dependencies
pip3 install --user matplotlib numpy scipy pyside2
```

On non-Debian systems, packages equivalent to the ones listed above will be needed. Feel free to contribute to [this issue](https://github.com/retallickj/siqad/issues/32) with dependencies required on other systems.


### Quick Compilation

First, clone the repository (including submodules) onto your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/retallickj/siqad.git
```

Next, run the `make_everything` script from the project root:
```
chmod +x make_everything
./make_everything --swig
```

If the `make_everything` script returns errors, please jump to the "Detailed Compilation" section and try again. Otherwise, you should be able to run the binary by running `./build/debug/siqad` from the project root.

We don't have a Linux installation process in place yet as the tool is still under active development, but we welcome ideas and contributions on that regard.


### Detailed Compilation

First, clone the repository (including submodules) onto your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/retallickj/qsi-sim.git
```

Next, compile SimAnneal:

```
cd siqad/src/phys/simanneal
make
```

Compile SWIG wrappers for AFM-Sim and PoisSolver:
TODO

Traverse make to the project root and build:
```
cd ../../..
qmake
make
make install
```

Don't be alarmed by `make install`, this won't install the simulator to your system. All it does is compile the binaries and copy the physics simulation files over to the compiled folders. We don't have a Linux installation process in place yet as the tool is still under active development, but we welcome ideas and contributions on that regard.

Finally, run `./build/debug/siqad` from the project root to invoke the GUI. In order to run a hopping animation, create a DB layout, click on the play button on the top bar, choose the "Hopping Animator" engine and run.



### Cross-compiling for Windows from a Ubuntu server

The cross-compiling guide uses [MXE (M Cross Environment)](http://mxe.cc/) for convenient access to pre-compiled cross-compilation binaries and toolchains. First, add their Debian PPA following the guide on their website: [http://pkg.mxe.cc/](http://pkg.mxe.cc/).

Install the following packages:
```
sudo apt install mxe-x86-64-w64-mingw32.static-boost mxe-i686-w64-mingw32.static-boost mxe-x86-64-w64-mingw32.static-qtbase mxe-x86-64-w64-mingw32.static-qtsvg mxe-i686-w64-mingw32.static-qtbase mxe-i686-w64-mingw32.static-qtsvg mxe-x86-64-w64-mingw32.static-qttools mxe-i686-w64-mingw32.static-qttools mxe-x86-64-w64-mingw32.static-qtcharts
```

MXE's Qt does not support compiling in DEBUG mode, so take out the `debug` flag from `CONFIG` and add the `release` flag in `db-sim.pro`:
```
CONFIG += release
```

From the root directory of siqad, create a `win64` directory. From that directory, run:
```
FOR_OS=win64 ../make_everything -swig
```

The `FOR_OS` flag informs the `make_everything` script which platform to cross-compile for, currently supported options are: `FOR_OS=<win32|win64>`. Leave blank if not cross-compiling.


## Licensing

The open source version of Qt5 falls under the GNU LGPL v3 license, as does the GUI code. Qt5 includes some packages which include third-party content under different licenses. If these are used their specific licenses must be considered. Refer to http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/licenses-used-in-qt.html for a list of third-party licensed libraries.
